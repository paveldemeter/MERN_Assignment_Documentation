## R1 Description of your website, including:

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to create an website for Raw Haricuts that will increase business exposure and revenue. 

#### Functionality / features

The features of the site are intended to showcase the feel for the shop, inform customers on hours and pricing, allow customers to book appointments and check availability, and showcase a gallery of photos of haircut types and examples. 

The functional features will allow customers to check available dates and times to schedule appointments, navigate the site via an easy to use nav/footer bar, and make purchases through a third party portal. The functional features will allow an admin to check and approve appointments for clients. 


#### Target audience

Our Clients main reason for building a business website is due to expanding the Target Audience, "Raw Barbershop" is limited to an audience age gap from 10-30 year, Our clients main expectation for deployment of this website application is to reach all ages but being a barbershop, It will be limited to males living in the Gold Coast metro-area who are looking for an occaional classic, modern, or specialty styled haircut. 

"Raw Barbershop" would also like to implement an after hours service in the near future to reach the audience of males who work a 9-5 job and are able to get haircuts in their time through a book system afer hours service.

#### Tech stack

The MERN tech stack will be incorporated into this project, the four open sourced components being MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. The noSQL database, MongoDB is utilized in the MERN stack. The backend server utilizes Node.js, Express, and mongoose. The front end utilizes React. 



#### Mongo - Cross Platform Database

MySQL is a relational database that  is based  on tabular design  whereas  NoSQL  is non-relational in nature with its document-based design.

  

Mongo is a is No-SQL document oriented database, Meaning it does not have the typical schema-design,  MongoDB  is schema-less & the data  is stored  in a JSON based query language.

  

MongoDB is commonly known for being easy to scale and flexible.

#### Express - A Back-end web app Framework

  

Express is a web app framework for Node JS, A boilerplate template server code for Node JS  if you will. Express is a very efficient for developers as there is no need to repeat the same code as you would with the Node.js HTTP module.

  

#### React - A Js Library for building UI

  

The React library  can be  used for creating views rendered in HTML. React is a great way to replace repetitive HTML or DOM templates as React is a full featured language (JS)  to build  repetitive or conditional DOM elements.

#### Node.js - A cross-platform runtime environment

NodeJS  is a platform for executing JS outside of the browser on the server-side. It  is used  with apps that  require a persistent  connection between the browser and the server.

  

As stated above, Node.js works without an enclosing HTML page, instead using its own module system to put together multiple JS files.
